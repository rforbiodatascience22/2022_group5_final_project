## Introduction



## Material and Methods - Data

- data is from GTex Portal, which is an open source portal to provide tissue specific gene expression data 

- Sample Attributes: contains data like sample ID, tissue or RIN number

- Gene Counts: The analyzed genes are given rowwise while the corresponding counts per each sample are shown in different columns

- Subject Phenotype: contains phenotype attributes of the subjects from who the samples were analyzed
