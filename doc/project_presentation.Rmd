## Introduction

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
<font size="3">

- Is there a difference in gene expression between male and female muscle tissue?

  - Data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data base.
  
  - Focus on the expression of 20,000 genes. 
  
  - Difference in cause of death and age (see figure).

## Material and Methods: Data files and analyses
<font size="3"> 
**File descriptions**

- 3 files from GTex Portal (open source):

  - Subject phenotype file: attributes of the subjects (Age and gender).
    
  - Sample attribute file: sample ID, tissue type, RIN number etc.
    
  - Gene counts file: Each row is a gene, each column is a sample from a patient. The cell value is the gene expression.

**Description of analyses**

- Principal Component Analysis

  - Reduce data dimension from 20,000 to 2
  
  - Look for initial signs of data clustering
  
- DESeq2

  - Calculate the log2fold change in gene expression between classes
  
  - Classes: male and female

## Material and Methods - Cleaning the data 

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
<font size="3"> 
**No. of rows x no. of columns before cleaning**

- Subject phenotypes: 980 x 4

- Sample attributes: 22951 x 63

- Gene reads: 500 x 9112

**No. of rows x no. of columns after cleaning**

- Subject phenotypes: 980 x 4

- Sample attributes: 9111 x 8

- Gene reads: 499 x 9112

</font>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="30%"}

```
</div>

## Material and Methods - Augmentation

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
<font size="3"> 
**No. of rows x no. of columns before cleaning**

- Subject phenotypes: 980 x 4

- Subject attributes: 22951 x 63

- Gene reads: 500 x 9112

**No. of rows x no. of columns after cleaning**

- Subject phenotypes: 980 x 4

- Sample attributes: 524 x 11

- Gene reads: 524 x 500

  - There are 524 patients in the final data frames

## Results - PCA 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/06_pca_plots.png")
```


## Results - Volcano Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/05_deseq2_volcano_plot.png")
```

## Results - Heatmap

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/05_heatmap.png")
```

## Discussion
<font size="3">

- PCA: Correcting for house-keeping-genes, samples clustered somewhat based on gender. 

- DESeq2:

  - Volcano plot: Several genes are differentially expressed. 
  
  - Heatmap: We did not see as clear a difference as we had expected, but there were some visible differences. 

- Variance between samples (age and cause of death)

  - We did not take this into account
  
  - Therefore, results are likely not replicable with new data. 
  
- Project is reproducible

  - Data and pipeline available on GitHub

- Choice of tissue
