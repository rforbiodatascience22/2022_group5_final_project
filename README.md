The general concept of this repository:
This repository analyses differences in RNA gene expression data from muscle tissue between male and female subjects retrieved from the GTEX database. The contents of the repository are separated into three main directories: R, results, and doc containing the scripts, our results, and the documentation, respectively. Furthermore, the gene expression analysis pipeline follows the order of data loading, cleaning, augmenting, and analysis, also indicated by the script names. 

Below is a short description of each R-script can be seen.
- 00_doit.R: Runs the entire RNA gene expression pipeline.
- 01_load.R: Three seperate dataset from the GTEX-database, which includes SampleAttributesDS.tsv, SubjectPhenotypesDS.tsv and gene_reads.tsv.gz.
- 02_clean.R: Applies our general cleaning strategy to both the SampleAttributesDS.tsv and gene_reads.tsv.gz
- 03_augment.R: Selects the Tissue type we want to analyze and transposes the gene_reads matrix.
- 04_analysis_descriptive_plots.R: Creates plots of the general trends of the data like the age distribution and death severity distribution of our selected tissue type.
- 05_analysis_DESeq2.R: Computes the DESeq2 analysis and summarizes the results using both a volcano plot and a heatmap.
- 06_PCA.R: Does Principal component analysis on both unnormalized and normalized data and plots the resulting projections onto PC1 and PC2.

The resulting plots from the scripts are saved in the directory results. 

Handling of NAs:

We dropped rows with NA values for gene counts in this analysis because you would not be able to fully compare the patients to each other if they contained missing values.

The dataset:

The data used to analyze gene expression was derived from the GTEX database, a database of RNA- and DNA-sequencing experiments of multiple tissue samples. A link to the raw data can be found below.

The following files are downloaded when running the pipelines.

GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDD.xlsx - Contains a general description of the samples like rin-number, tissue type and death severity.
GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SubjectPhenotypesDD.xlsx - Contains a general description of the patients like age and gender.
GTEx_Analysis_2017-0605_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_reads.gct.gz - Contains the actual read counts of the tissues and the Ensemble-ids of the genes. The columns of the dataset are the sample ids, and the rows are the genes annotated with ensemble ids.
